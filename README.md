## 🗃 React Component Lib Boilerplate w/ Storybook

Boilerplate app for building your own React library with Storybook UI Component Explorer

### ⚡️ Scripts

Run `yarn` to install the dependencies

Run `yarn start` to start the applications

- React App `localhost:3000`
- Storybook UI Explorer `localhost:6006`

Once you're ready to publish run `yarn compile` and `yarn publish` to share your library.

If you'd like to use the library locally:

- Run `yarn link`
- Go to your project's folder `cd into-your-project-folder`
- Run `yarn link 'my-react-lib-plus'`

This will create a symlink named **_your-project-folder/node_modules/my-react-lib-plus_** that links to your local copy of the `my-react-lib-plus` project. 🎉

### ⚙️ Usage

Create a new folder inside `src/components` for your component and start building.

Make sure to import/export your components from the `src/components/index.js` file.

**@ src/components/index.js**

```jsx
export { default as MyComponent } from './components/YOUR-COMPONENT'
```

**@ src/App.js**

```jsx
import { MyComponent } from 'my-react-lib-plus'
```
